slicerbot is an AutoHotKey Script to automate credit / resource generation in SW:TOR.

slicerbot operates by using image searches to identify key components to click on, such as the slicing icon, the accept button, credit boxes, pending missions, etc.  

The use of image searching should (hopefully) make slicerbot resolution-agnostic. Unfortuantely, because I've only tested at one resolution, it's possible that we'll need to implement some kind of scaling logic in our image searches, because our images were taken at 1920x1080.

== USING SLICERBOT ==

1. Move the contents of the repository to a directory of chosing.
2. Open slicebot.ahk and change the BaseDir directory to the directory you created in step 1.  Slicerbot needs to know where to find the image resources for image searching.
3. Set the value of MaxTier.  Slicerbot needs to know which level to "level down" to if it fails to find any high-level lockbox quests.
4. Load the script into AutoHotkey
5. Log into SWTOR
6. Clear your screen of all the windows.
7. Press F1 to start the script
8. Press F2 when you want to stop the script.  The script will complete its current cycle before notifying you that it has finished running.

== Troubleshooting ==

Q: My guy never clicks on anything!
A: You might be able to tweak the image search sensitivity so Slicerbot recognizes things.  

In the script, anywhere it does an ImageSearch, find the *n before *TransBlack.  To increase tolerance, increase the value of n.  It has a maximum value of 255.  Note that if you do this, you risk having the script click on random icons.

Q: This is so cool!  I am a millionaire now!  How do I give back to the creator?

Q: Hey do u make it do anyting else like dipolemacy or arceology?
A: Send many bitcoins to 1AhGPuzEE4pRWQpsdGrTtSGqc881td4T1Q

Q: I don't have enough credits to send my guy out on a mission and it's looping indefinitely!
A: Make sure you have enough credits before starting slicerbot.  Be friendly to your companions as I am not responsible for their slicing ineptitude and squandering of your money.

Seriously though, by using slicerbot you will level up if you haven't already.  When your companions unlock new slicing tiers, there is a good chance that they will be failing frequently on expensive missions.  I have added tiers so that if it doesn't find a lockbox quest on your current level it will drop down a level and look for lockbox quests there, but it won't do that if there are high-level lockbox quests to be had, and there is a good chance that you will fail these.

Ok disclaimer is over.  You will be a millionaire.
